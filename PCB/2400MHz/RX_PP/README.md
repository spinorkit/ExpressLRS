# PP 2.4 GHz Rx

This rx is a remix of the RX_CCG_Nano, so credit to @juhtipuhti for the initial design.

The PP is a 10 x 10mm rx with a chip antenna and weighs in at 0.42g!

The base of the PCB can be assembled by JLC, leaving you only 5 components on the top to place.  It is recommended to also order a stencil for solder paste.  A hot air station is required.

### PCB and Stencil Order

Upload the Gerber file to https://cart.jlcpcb.com/RAT quote and below are the order options.  You will need to do a separate order for the stencil.  If you decrease the PCB Qty to 5 you will be given the addition option to have all 5 or only 2 PCB assembled under SMT Assembly.

Upload the BOM and PickAndPlace files.

Confirm the selected components.  If you get a red 'No part selected' warning, press Search and search by part number (its starts with a C) and select the 0402 size.

The final review will probably look wrong and with components rotated incorrectly.  This appears to be normal and production will still be ok.  To date I have had good communication with JLC if there are production issues and they get in contact before starting.

### Build layout cheat sheet

- FW520WFMT1 has no orientation.  Just have the longest dimension left to right.
- sx1280 the dot is in the top right
- RF output filter red dot to the left
- LED, ground (cathode) is the upper pad
- Antenna the build video has details at 16:40 https://youtu.be/LP0_UdjuBik?t=1001

### Flashing

The first flash will require connecting a st link to SWCLK, SWDIO, 5V and GND.  After this it can be updated through Betaflight passthrough.  Flash the DIY_2400_RX_STM32_CCG_Nano_v0_5_via_STLINK and DIY_2400_RX_STM32_CCG_Nano_v0_5_via_BetaflightPassthrough targets.
